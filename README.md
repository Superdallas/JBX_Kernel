JBX-Kernel for Motorola XT910/XT912 OMAP4 (D-WiZ JBX Rom Series - Battery Saving Technologies)



Some features:

- Custom Voltage
- Live Overclock
- Custom OPP-Table
- Reduced latency
- Underclocked
- Increased R/W Ahead


...more to come



WIP:

- Need fix to force the CPU to stay on custom min freq OPP0 (for now temporary solved by script daemon in Rom)
- Live OC function included but doesn't work


This Kernel is based on the Motorola 3.0.8 Kernel for Kexec which was initiated by the STS-Dev-Team.
